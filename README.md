# Software Engineering Data Science Questions

This repo contains a collection of questions that you will find on a Software Engineering interview. These are publicly available questions you will find on the internet through various sources.

I have taken the liberty to detail as many of the steps possible, even citing verbatim from the source. I have added my own commentary and thoughts on some of the questions.

The solutions provided have been tested and verified to pass. That said, I like many others speak from experience. Memorizing the answers, and not understanding the concepts, and or approach to solving the problem is an exercise in futility.

You only hurt yourself and you perpetuate a malfeseance that hurts all of us. I urge you to take the time to practice as much as possible eventhough you may not undertstand it.

Programming is summarized by the infamous quote:

    "Garbage, in, garbage out"

Lastly, I make no claims to the ownership of any of these questions or solutions. I went with what was the easiest for me to understand and implement. I have done my best to cite the source with both the question and the solution.

If you feel that I may have violated any of your intellectual property rights, just hit me up and I will gladly remove it.

No harm no foul. As an open source advocate, I am ardent in my belief that we must use the information age for good, instead of feverishly and incessecantly trying to elevate our status quo.

Carpe Diem!
