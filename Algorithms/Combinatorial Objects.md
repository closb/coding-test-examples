# Combinatorial Objects

Formulating combinatorial objects in terms of computing properties is a powerful technique for solving problems. The following are common structures that will aid in solving problems.

## Permutations

Are arrangements or orderings of objects (items). They are most likely the object in question when the problem statement seeks the following;

    * arrangments
    * tour
    * orderings
    * sequence

## Subsets

Are selections from a set of objects(items). The order of the subsets does not matter like they matter in permutations. They are most likely the object in question when the problem statement seeks the following;

    * cluster
    * collection
    * committee
    * group
    * packaging
    * selection

## Trees

Are representations of heirarchies. They are most likely the object in question when the problem statement seeks the following;

    * dominance relationship
    * ancestor/descendant relationship
    * taxonomy

## Graphs

Are representations of relationships between an arbitrary pairs of objects(items). They are most likely the object in question when the problem statement seeks the following;

    * network
    * circuit
    * web
    * relationship

## Points 

Are represented by locations in a geomtric space on a map/plane. They are most likely the object in question when the problem statement seeks the following;

    * positions
    * data records
    * locations

## Polygons

Are regions represented in geometric spaces, like the borders of a country can be described by a polygon on a map/plane. The are most likely the object in question when the problem statement seeks the following;

    * shapes
    * regions
    * configurations
    * boundaries

## Strings

Are represented by a sequences of characters or patterns. They are most likely the object in questoin when the problem statement seeks the following;

    * text
    * characters
    * patterns
    * labels

### Familiarity with these fundemental structures is important since they provide the lanquages used to model applications. You must become fluent in the vocabulary.
