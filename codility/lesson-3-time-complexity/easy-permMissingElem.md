# INSTRUCTIONS

An array A consisting of N different integers is given. The array contains integers in the range [1..(N + 1)], which means that exactly one element is missing.

Your goal is to find that missing element.

Write a function:

function solution(A);

that, given an array A, returns the value of the missing element.

For example, given array A such that:

  A[0] = 2
  A[1] = 3
  A[2] = 1
  A[3] = 5
the function should return 4, as it is the missing element.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
the elements of A are all distinct;
each element of array A is an integer within the range [1..(N + 1)].

``` javascript

/**
 * @param {number[]} A - array of N different integers
 * @param {number} N - integer within the range [0..100,000]
 * @returns {number} - the value of the missing element
 */
function solution(A) {        
    A.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    // Check if the array has a single element
    if (A.length === 1) {
        return A[0] === 1 ? 2 : 1;
    }
    
    // Check if the first element is missing
    if (A[0] !== 1) {
        return 1;
    }
    
    var missingElem;
    for (var i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
        if (A[i] + 1 !== A[i + 1]) {
            missingElem = A[i] + 1;
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // If no missing element was found in the middle of the array, the missing element is the last one
    return missingElem !== undefined ? missingElem : A.length + 1;
}
```

## ANALYSIS SUMMARY

+ The solution obtained perfect score.
+ No time complexity analysis provided.
+ Detected time complexity: O(N) or O(N * log(N))

## DETECTED TIME COMPLEXITY

+ Detected time complexity: O(N) or O(N * log(N))

## ALGORITHM EXPLANATION

The solution uses a for loop to loop through the array and check if the next element is one more than the current element. If it is not, then we have found the missing element. The solution sorts the array first and then loops through the array. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N * log(N)).

## CODE EXPLANATION

The solution sorts the array first and then loops through the array. The time complexity of this algorithm is O(N * log(N)).
