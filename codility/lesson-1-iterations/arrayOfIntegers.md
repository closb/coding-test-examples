# INSTRUCTIONS

 Write a function that given an array A of N integers returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

/**

* @param N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
* @param A is an array of integers within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000];
*
* example, given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.
* example, given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.
 **/

 steps

  1. sort the array
  2. set a variable to 1
  3. loop through the array
  4. if the current element is equal to the variable, increment the variable
  5. return the variable

``` javascript
function solution(A) {
  let sortedArr = A.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  let smallestNum = 1;
  for (let i = 0; i < sortedArr.length; i++) {
    if (sortedArr[i] === smallestNum) {
      smallestNum++;
    }
  }
  return smallestNum;
}
```

## EXPLANATION

The provided JavaScript function, named solution, takes an `array A` as an input. The purpose of this function is to find the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in the array.

The function begins by sorting the array in ascending order using the sort() method. This method sorts the elements of an array in place and returns the array. The sort order is built upon converting the elements into strings, then comparing their sequences of UTF-16 code unit values. To sort numbers in ascending order, a compare function (a, b) => a - b is passed as an argument to the sort() method.

Next, the function initializes a variable smallestNum to 1. This variable will hold the smallest positive integer that does not occur in the array.

The function then enters a for loop, which iterates over each element in the sorted array. Inside the loop, it checks if the current array element is equal to smallestNum. If it is, smallestNum is incremented by 1. This process continues until the loop has iterated over all elements in the array.

Finally, the function returns smallestNum, which, after the completion of the loop, holds the smallest positive integer that does not occur in the array. If all positive integers up to the length of the array are present in the array, smallestNum will be equal to the length of the array plus 1

## TIME COMPLEXITY

The time complexity of the solution function is O(N log N). This is because the function uses the sort() method, which typically has a time complexity of O(N log N) in JavaScript. The for loop that follows has a time complexity of O(N), but when combined, the overall time complexity is dominated by the more expensive O(N log N) operation.

## SPACE COMPLEXITY

The space complexity of the solution function is O(1). This is because the function only uses a fixed amount of space to store the sorted array and the smallestNum variable. The space used does not increase with the size of the input array, so the space complexity is constant.

## WORST-CASE TIME COMPLEXITY

GitHub Copilot: The worst-case time complexity of the `sort()` method in JavaScript is O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because most JavaScript engines implement the `sort()` method using sorting algorithms like QuickSort, MergeSort, or TimSort, which all have a worst-case time complexity of O(n log n).

## BEST-CASE TIME COMPLEXITY

The best-case time complexity of the sort() method in JavaScript is not officially specified as it can vary between different JavaScript engines and their implementation of the sort() method. However, in many cases, it can be O(n log n), the same as the average and worst-case scenarios, especially if the sorting algorithm used is MergeSort or HeapSort. Some JavaScript engines may use a different sorting algorithm for small arrays (like insertion sort), which has a best-case time complexity of O(n) when the input is already sorted. But for larger arrays, the time complexity is generally O(n log n).


## OTHER SORTING ALGORITHMS

GitHub Copilot: JavaScript's built-in `sort()` method uses a sorting algorithm that can vary between different JavaScript engines. However, you can implement your own sorting algorithms in JavaScript. Here are a few examples:

1. **Bubble Sort**: This is a simple comparison-based algorithm. It works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. However, it's not suitable for large data sets due to its high time complexity of O(n^2).

2. **Selection Sort**: This algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted part and putting it at the beginning. Like Bubble Sort, it also has a time complexity of O(n^2), making it inefficient on large lists.

3. **Insertion Sort**: This algorithm builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It's much less efficient on large lists than more advanced algorithms like QuickSort, HeapSort, or MergeSort.

4. **QuickSort**: This is a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then recursively sorted. The average and worst-case time complexity is O(n log n).

5. **MergeSort**: This is also a divide-and-conquer algorithm. It divides the unsorted list into n sublists, each containing one element (a list of one element is considered sorted), then repeatedly merges sublists to produce new sorted sublists until there is only one sublist remaining. The average and worst-case time complexity is O(n log n).

6. **HeapSort**: This comparison-based sorting algorithm divides its input into a sorted and an unsorted region, and it iteratively shrinks the unsorted region by extracting the largest element and moving that to the sorted region. The time complexity is O(n log n).

7. **Counting Sort**: This algorithm works by counting the number of objects having distinct key values (kind of hashing). Then, it uses arithmetic to calculate the position of each object in the output sequence. The time complexity is O(n + k), where n is the number of elements in the input array and k is the range of input.

8. **Radix Sort**: This is a non-comparative integer sorting algorithm that sorts data with integer keys by grouping keys by the individual digits which share the same significant position and value. The time complexity is O(nk), where n is the number of elements in the input array and k is the number of digits in the largest number.

9. **Bucket Sort**: This algorithm works by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets. Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting algorithm or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm. The time complexity is O(n + k), where n is the number of elements in the input array and k is the number of buckets.

10. **Shell Sort**: This algorithm is a generalization of insertion sort that allows the exchange of items that are far apart. The time complexity is O(n log n).

11. **Comb Sort**: This is an improvement over Bubble Sort. It works by comparing elements that are far apart, and then reducing the gap between them. The time complexity is O(n^2).

12. **Cycle Sort**: This is an in-place sorting algorithm that works by arranging the elements in the array such that the value of the element is equal to its index. The time complexity is O(n^2).

13. **Gnome Sort**: This is a sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order. The time complexity is O(n^2).

Remember, the choice of sorting algorithm can depend on the specific requirements of your code, including the size of the input data, the nature of the data, and the desired time complexity
