// write a function that given a string S describing phone calls returns the amount of money the company has to pay you in cents.

// example given a string S with N = 3 lines:

// "00:01:07,400-234-090\n00:05:01,701-080-080\n00:05:00,400-234-090"
// the function should return 900 ( the total duration of number 400-234-090 is 6 minutes 7 seconds, and the total duration of number 701-080-080 is 5 minutes 1 second, therefore the company has to pay you 900 cents)
