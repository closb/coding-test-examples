# HackerRank Practice Test Solutions

The following solutions are from practice test from the HackerRank website. I have personally typed this out verbatim in order to keep the instructions and code as close to original as possible.

After doing a couple you come to realize the bulk of these problems are solved using basic boilerplate logic. The more you do, the quicker you realize the patterns and ultimately you'll be able to solve them with your eyes closed.

I have not gone through all of the solutions, so there are some that are missing details. Similarly, since my methodology was to solve as many as possible with the shortest and simplest solution. The solutions are not optimized for more advanced scenarios and/or use cases.

# It's elementary my dear Watson

Whether or not you understand the solution, take the time to type them out word for word. Starting with the instructions from top to bottom. Handle coding like writing 100 lines in Elementary school when you got in trouble.

You'll be surprised how much you actually learn this way. In the end, "practice makes perfect."
